            "Description": "Do you know what scalability really is? It's a mathematical function that's simple, precise, and useful. REALLY useful. It describes the relationship between system performance and load. In this talk you'll learn the function (the Universal Scalability Law), how it describes and predicts system behavior you see every day, and how to use it in practice. I'll show you how to understand the function, how to capture the data you need to measure your own system's behavior (you probably already have that), and how to analyze the data with the USL. You'll leave this talk knowing exactly what scalability is and what causes non-linear scaling. There are two factors, and you'll start seeing those everywhere, too. As a result, when systems don't scale you'll know what kind of problem to look for, and you'll avoid building bottlenecks into your systems in the first place. Final note: this talk requires zero mathematical skill.\n",

            "Description": "Cloud! Autoscaling! Kubernetes! Etc! In theory, it's easier than ever to scale a service based on variable demand. In practice, it's still hard to take observed metrics, and translate them into quantitative predictions about what will happen to service performance as load changes. Resource limits are often chosen by guesstimation, and teams are likely to find themselves reacting to slowdowns and bottlenecks, rather than anticipating them. Queueing theory can help, by treating large-scale software systems as mathematical models that you can rigorously reason about. But it's not necessarily easy to translate between real-world systems and textbook models. This talk will cover practical techniques for turning operational data into actionable predictions. We'll show how to use the Universal Scalability Law to develop a model of system performance, and how to leverage that model to make more informed capacity planning and architectural decisions. We'll discuss what data to gather in production to better inform its predictions -- for example, why it's important to capture the shape of a latency distribution, and not just a few percentiles. We'll also talk about some of the limitations and pitfalls of performance modelling.\n",

He argues that simply implementing Agile practices without addressing underlying systemic issues, such as lengthy feedback loops and inefficient decision-making processes, will not lead to significant improvements. Instead, he proposes that organizations focus on creating rapid feedback loops, reducing batch sizes, and adopting an experimental approach to product development and process improvement, emphasizing value over cost and estimation.\n",

            "Description": "Modern software development welcomes changing requirements, even late in the process, but how can we write our software so that those changes don\u2019t create a mess? Evolutionary design is the key. It\u2019s a technique that emerges from Extreme Programming, the method that brought us test-driven development, merciless refactoring, and continuous integration. James Shore first encountered Extreme Programming and evolutionary design nearly 20 years ago. Initially skeptical, he\u2019s explored its boundaries ever since. In this session, James will share what he\u2019s learned through in-depth animations of real software projects. You\u2019ll see how designs evolve over time and you\u2019ll learn how and when to use evolutionary design for your own projects. Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDZCF8jfeMc\n",
