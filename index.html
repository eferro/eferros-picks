    <h1>Recomended Talks</h1>
<center><img src="images/honey_badger-eferro-no-bg-small.png" alt="eferro logo" /></center>
<p>These recommended talks represent my personal take on software delivery and product development, shaped by both my real-world experiences and my guiding principles around Agile, XP, Continuous Delivery, and Lean thinking. They aren’t meant to be a comprehensive or neutral collection—rather, they showcase how I’ve seen teams thrive when we embrace flow, high-quality code, and tight feedback loops. If you’d like to learn about the premises that form the backbone of my approach, please check out <a href="https://www.eferro.net/p/my-premises-about-software-development.html">My Premises About Software Development</a>.</p>
<p>Because I firmly believe in going fast by maintaining high quality and always remembering that software is a means to an end, you’ll notice a theme of close collaboration, small safe steps, and continuous learning throughout these talks. These beliefs stem directly from my hands-on experience, and I’ve seen their impact across multiple projects. For more insights into my approach, visit my <a href="https://www.eferro.net">Blog (eferro's random stuff)</a>, where I delve deeper into Lean Software Development, Lean Product Development, XP practices, and the value of reliable, evolving code.</p>

You’re probably writing 2-5% of the integrated tests you need to test thoroughly. You’re probably duplicating unit tests all over the place. Your integrated tests probably duplicate each other all over the place. When an integrated test fails, who knows what’s broken? Integrated tests probably do you more harm than good.

Evolutionary design is the key. It’s a technique that emerges from Extreme Programming, the method that brought us test-driven development, merciless refactoring, and continuous integration. James Shore first encountered Extreme Programming and evolutionary design nearly 20 years ago. Initially skeptical, he’s explored its boundaries ever since. In this session, James will share what he’s learned through in-depth animations of real software projects. You’ll see how designs evolve over time and you’ll learn how and when to use evolutionary design for your own projects. Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDZCF8jfeMc

It's a mathematical function that's simple, precise, and useful. REALLY useful. It describes the relationship between system performance and load. In this talk you'll learn the function (the Universal Scalability Law), how it describes and predicts system behavior you see every day, and how to use it in practice. I'll show you how to understand the function, how to capture the data you need to measure your own system's behavior (you probably already have that), and how to analyze the data with the USL. You'll leave this talk knowing exactly what scalability is and what causes non-linear scaling. There are two factors, and you'll start seeing those everywhere, too. As a result, when systems don't scale you'll know what kind of problem to look for, and you'll avoid building bottlenecks into your systems in the first place. Final note: this talk requires zero mathematical skill.

      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hda5tMrLJqc">Queueing Theory in Practice: Performance Modeling for the Working Engineer</a> (<strong>Eben Freeman</strong>) <strong>[Architecture, Scalability, Performance, Software Design]</strong> <strong>[Duration: 45:00]</strong> Cloud! Autoscaling! Kubernetes! Etc! In theory, it's easier than ever to scale a service based on variable demand. In practice, it's still hard to take observed metrics, and translate them into quantitative predictions about what will happen to service performance as load changes. Resource limits are often chosen by guesstimation, and teams are likely to find themselves reacting to slowdowns and bottlenecks, rather than anticipating them. Queueing theory can help, by treating large-scale software systems as mathematical models that you can rigorously reason about. But it's not necessarily easy to translate between real-world systems and textbook models. This talk will cover practical techniques for turning operational data into actionable predictions. We'll show how to use the Universal Scalability Law to develop a model of system performance, and how to leverage that model to make more informed capacity planning and architectural decisions. We'll discuss what data to gather in production to better inform its predictions -- for example, why it's important to capture the shape of a latency distribution, and not just a few percentiles. We'll also talk about some of the limitations and pitfalls of performance modelling.
